# DevOps Project 1
This project was made to develop my DevOps Skills.
It includes developing containerization skills and automating application builds.

The project was based on simple application with front-end and backend.

  - Docker Compose service for systemd systemctl control
- Automatization
  - Pipeline
    - Containers auto assembly
    - Unit and style tests for code
    - Dockle vulnerability tests
    - Deploy to the production server as systemd service using bash script
